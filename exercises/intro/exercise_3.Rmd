# Create a subset `sub` of the `CO2` dataset that only contains `Quebec` data where `conc` are greater than or equal to 675.

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```

# The units of CO2 uptake are in umol/m^2 sec. Create a new column in the `sub` subset called `uptake_min`, which contains the CO2 uptake rate in minutes (i.e. the value multiplied by 60).

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```

# For all plants subject to a CO2 concentration greater than or equal to 500, what is the median uptake across each plant type, treatment, and CO2 concentration?

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```

# Determine how many (hint: `tally()`) plants of each `Type` experienced each condition (Treatment and concentration).

```{r}
# Write your answer here
