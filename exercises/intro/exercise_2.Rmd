# What are the minimum and maximum concentrations at which the plants were tested in the `CO2` data set?
```{r}
# Write your answer here
```

# Let's add a new variable to the `CO2` dataframe named `conc_L`, which is the concentration in L/L (i.e., `conc_L` = `conc`/1000). Confirm that a new variable was added to the dataset by using the `names()` function.
```{r}
# Write your answer here
```

# Make a scatterplot of the uptake versus concentration from the `CO2` data set. Use a `col=CO2$Type` argument to differentiate the data by region.
