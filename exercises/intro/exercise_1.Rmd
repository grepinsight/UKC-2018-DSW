# Use the ? help operator to understand what the sample function does.

```{r}
# Write your answer here
?sample
```

# Create a vector 'coeffs' of 3 coefficients for a quadratic equation, using the 'sample' function. Draw a sample of size 3 from [-10,10] with replacement.

```{r}
# Write your answer here
coeffs <-sample(-20:20, 3, replace = TRUE)
```

# Determine the class of the vector 'coeffs'.

```{r}
# Write your answer here
class(coeffs)
```

# Assign the 3 values from the vector 'coeffs' to variables "a", "b", and "c", respectively.

```{r}
# Write your answer here
a <- coeffs[1]
b <- coeffs[2]
c <- coeffs[3]
```

# Evaluate the discriminant of the quadratic equation, which is calculated as (b^2 - 4ac).
```{r}
# Write your answer here
b^2 - 4*a*c
```
