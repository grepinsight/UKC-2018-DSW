# Use the `?` help operator to understand what the sample function does.

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```

# Create a vector `coeffs` of 3 coefficients for a quadratic equation, using the `sample` function. Draw a sample of size 3 from [-10,10] with replacement.

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```

# Determine the class of the vector `coeffs`.

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```

# Assign the 3 values from the vector `coeffs` to variables `a`, `b`, and `c`, respectively.

```{r}
# Write your answer here
```

# Evaluate the discriminant of the quadratic equation, which is calculated as (b^2 - 4ac).
```{r}
# Write your answer here
```
